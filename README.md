## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you are familiar with the following:
- Writing code in JavaScript
- Operating a terminal
- Using Git
- Understanding the basics of how smart contracts work

## Initialization
First, let's set up our Node.js environment for U2U smart contract development.

1. Create a folder for your project:
    ```sh
    mkdir first-contract
    cd first-contract
    ```

2. Create an empty Node.js project:
    ```sh
    npm init -y
    ```

3. Add Hardhat as a dependency to the project:
    ```sh
    npm install --save-dev hardhat
    ```

4. Initialize your Hardhat project:
    ```sh
    npx hardhat init
    ```

5. Select "Create a TypeScript project" when prompted:
    ```

    üë∑ Welcome to Hardhat v2.17.4 üë∑‚Äç

    ? What do you want to do? ‚Ä¶
      Create a JavaScript project
    ‚ùØ Create a TypeScript project
      Create an empty hardhat.config.js
      Quit
    ```

6. Follow the prompts to complete the setup:
    ```
    ‚úî What do you want to do? ¬∑ Create a TypeScript project
    ‚úî Hardhat project root: ¬∑ /path/to/your/project
    ‚úî Do you want to add a .gitignore? (Y/n) ¬∑ y
    ‚úî Do you want to install this sample project's dependencies with npm (@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox)? (Y/n) ¬∑ y
    ```

Your project should now contain the following folders and files:
- `contracts/`
- `scripts/`
- `test/`
- `hardhat.config.ts`

## Creating Your First Smart Contract
1. Open the `contracts` folder and locate the `Lock.sol` file. This is a sample contract initialized by Hardhat.

2. `Lock.sol` is a simple time-locked wallet contract. Below is a breakdown of its components:

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
    pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

    // Uncomment this line to use console.log
    // import "hardhat/console.sol";

    contract Lock {
        uint public unlockTime;
        address payable public owner;

        event Withdrawal(uint amount, uint when);

        constructor(uint _unlockTime) payable {
            require(block.timestamp < _unlockTime, "Unlock time should be in the future");

            unlockTime = _unlockTime;
            owner = payable(msg.sender);
        }

        function withdraw() public {
            // Uncomment this line, and the import of "hardhat/console.sol", to print a log in your terminal
            // console.log("Unlock time is %o and block timestamp is %o", unlockTime, block.timestamp);

            require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime, "You can't withdraw yet");
            require(msg.sender == owner, "You aren't the owner");

            emit Withdrawal(address(this).balance, block.timestamp);

            owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
    ```

## Writing Automated Tests
To test our contract, we'll use Hardhat Network, a local blockchain network similar to U2U network. It comes built-in with Hardhat.

1. Open the `test` folder and delete the contents of `Lock.ts`.

2. Structure your test file like this:

    ```typescript
    import { expect } from "chai";
    import { ethers } from "hardhat";
    import { time } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox/network-helpers";

    describe("Lock", function () {
        it("Should set the right unlockTime", async function () {
            const ONE_YEAR_IN_SECS = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60;
            const ONE_GWEI = 1_000_000_000;

            const lockedAmount = ONE_GWEI;
            const unlockTime = (await time.latest()) + ONE_YEAR_IN_SECS;

            const Lock = await ethers.getContractFactory("Lock");
            const lock = await Lock.deploy(unlockTime, { value: lockedAmount });

            expect(await lock.unlockTime()).to.equal(unlockTime);
        });

        it("Should set the right owner", async function () {
            const ONE_YEAR_IN_SECS = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60;
            const ONE_GWEI = 1_000_000_000;

            const lockedAmount = ONE_GWEI;
            const unlockTime = (await time.latest()) + ONE_YEAR_IN_SECS;
            const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();

            const Lock = await ethers.getContractFactory("Lock");
            const lock = await Lock.deploy(unlockTime, { value: lockedAmount });

            expect(await lock.owner()).to.equal(owner.address);
        });
    });
    ```

3. Run your tests:
    ```sh
    npx hardhat test
    ```

## Deploying Your Smart Contract
After testing your contract, you can deploy it to the U2U network.

1. Create a deployment script `deploy.ts` in the `scripts` folder:

    ```typescript
    import { ethers } from "hardhat";

    async function main() {
        const currentTimestampInSeconds = Math.round(Date.now() / 1000);
        const unlockTime = currentTimestampInSeconds + 60;

        const lockedAmount = ethers.parseEther("0.001");

        const lock = await ethers.deployContract("Lock", [unlockTime], {
            value: lockedAmount,
        });

        await lock.waitForDeployment();

        console.log(
            `Lock with ${ethers.formatEther(lockedAmount)} U2U and unlock timestamp ${unlockTime} deployed to ${lock.target}`
        );
    }

    main().catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exitCode = 1;
    });
    ```

2. Configure the network in `hardhat.config.ts`:

    ```typescript
    import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
    import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

    const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
        solidity: "0.8.19",
        networks: {
            nebulas: {
                url: 'https://rpc-nebulas-testnet.uniultra.xyz/',
                accounts: ["YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"], // it should start with 0x...
            }
        },
        etherscan: {
            apiKey: {
                nebulas: "abc", // arbitrary string
            },
            customChains: [
                {
                    network: "nebulas",
                    chainId: 2484,
                    urls: {
                        apiURL: "https://testnet.u2uscan.xyz/api",
                        browserURL: "https://testnet.u2uscan.xyz"
                    }
                },
            ]
        }
    };

    export default config;
    ```

3. Run the deployment script:
    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network nebulas
    ```
